# Emacs Setup

This project details my emacs configuration.

When it comes to emacs, I agree with the following:

    Constructing a solid configuration is ultimately a personal
    journey for which you must take the first steps.

                    - technomancy, Emacs Starter Kit, v3

My first steps in this journey begin with a
[literately programmed][lp] approach.

Warm Regards,

## Inventory

* The idea is that I clone this repository to a machine where I don't
  have a ~/.emacs.d. Then I run [install.sh][install.sh].

* The configuration is spread across `.org` files in the `org/`
  directory.

* The `.org` files can be assembled into a single `.org` file:
  [emacs-setup.org][emacs-setup.org]

* This single `.org` file can be translated (tangled) into a `.el`
  file: [emacs-setup.el][emacs-setup.el]

* The single `.org` file can be translated (woven) into a `.pdf`:
  [emacs-setup.pdf][emacs-setup-pdf].
