# Emacs Setup

This project details my emacs configuration.

The configuration is "[literately programmed][lp]," and this means
that there is an associated explanation for most parts of it.

You can proceed however you choose:

* By looking through the .org files within. The elisp of the
  configuration is spread throughout the .org files. It takes longer
  to read, but you get commentary this way.
* By looking through the init.el file within. No comments, just elisp.

Because it is literately programmed with Org-mode, the same
configuration that I run every day can be translated and published as
a PDF. The PDF that's generated from this configuration
[is available here][emacs-setup-pdf].
