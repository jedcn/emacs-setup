** Whitespace Cleanup

  Like most people, I hate trailing whitespace.

  This elisp creates a function that cleans up whitespace, and adds a
  hook that invokes it each time you save.

  It comes from a post within "what the emacs.d," specifically titled
  [[http://whattheemacsd.com/buffer-defuns.el-01.html][buffer defuns]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun cleanup-buffer-safe ()
    "Perform a bunch of safe operations on the whitespace content of a buffer."
    (interactive)
    (untabify (point-min) (point-max))
    (delete-trailing-whitespace)
    (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8))

  (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'cleanup-buffer-safe)
#+end_src
