* General

** UTF-8

  I picked this up from Magnars in his [[https://github.com/magnars/.emacs.d/blob/master/sane-defaults.el][sane-defaults.el]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
#+end_src

** Start Server

  As the documentation states:

    Allow this Emacs process to be a server for client processes.

  In particular, this allows me to setup my git configuration like so:

     git config --global core.editor /usr/local/bin/emacsclient

  And then, if any git command issued through the terminal needs an
  editor, my single running instance of Emacs can provide the edits.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (server-start)
#+end_src
