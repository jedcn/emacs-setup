** Start Server

  As the documentation states:

    Allow this Emacs process to be a server for client processes.

  In particular, this allows me to setup my git configuration like so:

     git config --global core.editor /usr/local/bin/emacsclient

  And then, if any git command issued through the terminal needs an
  editor, my single running instance of Emacs can provide the edits.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (server-start)
#+end_src
